		<h3>Don't get frustrated, you can do this!</h3>

		<p>Whenever you're having a hard time being patient with yourself, remember how important it is to meditate on not judging yourself!!! You are an intelligent human being who is more than capable when you set your mind to finishing something you begin. It just takes encouraging yourself in your resilience. Be kind to yourself and your resilience will strengthen.</p>
